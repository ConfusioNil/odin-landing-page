A Project assignment from the Odin Project to create a website using html and css.

Method:

Add all html elements I see on the png.
Add basic flex containers to the html I just added by making their direction as a column
Add flex and make the header and footer not growable, while the others are.

In working order I should do the css for:

Header.
Main Content.
Quote.
Call to Action.
Footer.

This way I can commit reguraly and go back to previous changes if need be.
